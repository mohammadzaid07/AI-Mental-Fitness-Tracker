PROJECT  OVERVIEW 

The AI Mental Fitness Tracker project aims to develop a machine learning-based system that monitors and enhances users' mental well-being. 

By collecting data from various sources, extracting meaningful features, and training a model, the project provides personalized insights, feedback, and interventions. 

The objectives include developing the AI-powered tracker, training a model to identify patterns related to mental well-being, improving the system through adaptive learning. 

Ultimately, the project empowers individuals to actively manage their mental health, detect issues early, and offer accessible support, while emphasizing the importance of professional mental health care.
